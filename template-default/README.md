# Starter

A minimal starting point for creating a custom element package.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies via [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```sh
npm install
```

## Development

To start the project in development mode, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command will launch the development server, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

## Build

To create a minified version of the package for production, execute:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will optimize your package for deployment, ensuring better performance.
